## 🏠 Project: YOLO: HOME

**Smart homes have become a highly relevant and popular topic within STEM education, providing students with practical exposure to real-world technology applications.**

In this project, we develop **Yolo:Home**, a smart home platform that combines conventional automation features with cutting-edge AI and IoT technologies. By integrating these advanced capabilities, the platform enhances user interaction and operational intelligence, bringing the concept of a modern smart home closer to reality.

### ✨ Key Features:
- 🌱 Environmental monitoring and automated device control.
- 🗣️ Voice recognition for hands-free operation.
- 😊 Facial recognition for personalized access control.
- 🔥 Fire detection using computer vision techniques for real-time hazard detection.
- 🌐 A dedicated web application for centralized monitoring and remote control.

### 🛠️ Technical Innovation:
A key innovation in this project is the **event-driven programming approach for the Yolo:Bit microcontroller**. Instead of using traditional sequential programming, the system leverages **MicroPython-based event-driven architecture**, enabling dynamic response to real-time events. This enhances flexibility and scalability for future feature development.

This report provides a comprehensive overview of the **Yolo:Home** project, detailing the technologies, hardware components, and system architecture that underpin the platform. Each core functionality is presented alongside the relevant technologies, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of the project and its alignment with modern AIoT trends.
